## Hub:
* The hub are way older and dumb(to say) device, which were used before switches arrived. These devices share the information to all the devices irrespective of the destination IpAddresses. THESE DEVISES ARE HIGHLY DISCOURAGED TO USE.

## Switch:
* The switches helps in connecting the devices and share the information correctly to the desired devices with in the LAN.
* In the OSI network model switches stands on layer2, which is the physical layer.
* To facilitate the information sharing between the devices connected to switch, it uses the mac addresses of devices.
* Since the first information packet transfer, the switch saves the mac addresses of the devices. To check the list of connected devices use this command ''' show mac-address-table '''. For the future references, the switch uses these mac addresses as unique identifiers for communication.
